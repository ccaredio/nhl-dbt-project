Welcome to your new dbt project!

### Purpose of this project

This dbt project is designed to showcase my understanding and skills with dbt. I am using a public NHL dataset from Kaggle and the 30-day free trial of Snowflake to replicate how I use dbt at my current position. The only stack I am not using is Fivetran for simplicities sake. 

My goal is to build a staging layer of data along with a few models that would be designed to be ready for use in a BI tool.
